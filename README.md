# PP_CPSC4150
Team coursework for CPSC 4150, the assignment was to create a mobile app to help with problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# ePITAPH
A digital memorial creation application for Android, intended to be a way for individuals to mourn the loss of loved ones in a safe way during COVID-19 as attending funerals can be dangerous currently. ePITAPH would allow users to create memorials, view, save and comment on memorials, contribute to memorials, find local memorials, and reply to others commenting on memorials. This will allow users to celebrate the memory of the deceased, as well as create a page celebrating their life without endangering others during the pandemic. ePITAPH provides a more solemn alternative to social media memorials that mimics the “photo album” aspect of a funeral service while still providing a communal space to mourn and share grief.
